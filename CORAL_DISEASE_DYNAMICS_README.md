# Coral Disease Dynamics Under Thermal Stress - Issue #1637

## Overview

This educational feature explores how warming oceans accelerate pathogen virulence and disease transmission in coral reef systems. As ocean temperatures rise due to climate change, corals become increasingly vulnerable to diseases, creating a dangerous feedback loop that threatens reef ecosystems worldwide.

## Scientific Content

### Thermal Stress and Coral Vulnerability
- **Immune Suppression**: Warm temperatures reduce antimicrobial compound production
- **Physiological Stress**: Increased metabolic demands and oxidative damage
- **Symbiont Disruption**: Zooxanthellae expulsion leading to bleaching and weakened immunity
- **Tissue Degradation**: Compromised epithelial barriers allowing pathogen invasion

### Pathogen Acceleration Mechanisms
- **Enhanced Growth Rates**: Bacteria reproduce faster in warmer waters
- **Increased Virulence**: Higher toxin production and virulence factor expression
- **Improved Survival**: Better pathogen persistence in thermal stress conditions
- **Transmission Facilitation**: Weakened host tissues enable easier pathogen spread

### Major Coral Diseases
- **White Band Disease**: Vibrio bacteria causing rapid tissue necrosis
- **Black Band Disease**: Cyanobacterial consortium with progressive death
- **White Syndrome**: Acute tissue loss associated with multiple pathogens
- **Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease**: Emerging disease of unknown etiology

### Case Studies
- **Caribbean Acropora Decline**: 1980s mass mortality following thermal stress
- **Great Barrier Reef Events**: 2016-2017 bleaching-disease cascade
- **Florida SCTLD Outbreak**: Rapid spread of emerging disease since 2014
