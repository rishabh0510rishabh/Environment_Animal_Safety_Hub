    <!-- Overview -->
    <div class="overview-section">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-pills"></i> Overview</h2>
      <p>Pharmaceutical residues, including antidepressants and hormones, are emerging contaminants in aquatic environments. These compounds enter waterways through wastewater effluent, sewage treatment plant discharges, and agricultural runoff. Fish and amphibians, as aquatic or semi-aquatic organisms, are particularly vulnerable due to their direct exposure during critical life stages. This document investigates the behavioral and reproductive effects of these pharmaceuticals on fish and amphibians, based on scientific evidence.</p>

    <!-- Effects on Fish -->

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Antidepressants</h3>
        <div class="effects-grid">
          <div class="effect-card">
            <h4>Behavioral Effects</h4>
            <p>SSRIs disrupt normal behavior by altering serotonin signaling. Studies show reduced feeding rates in species like fathead minnows (<em>Pimephales promelas</em>) and zebrafish (<em>Danio rerio</em>), potentially due to serotonin-induced satiety or anxiety-like responses. Aggression and social interactions are also affected; for instance, fluoxetine exposure leads to decreased territorial behavior in male guppies (<em>Poecilia reticulata</em>). Predator avoidance may be impaired, increasing vulnerability to predation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effect-card">
            <h4>Reproductive Effects</h4>
            <p>Exposure causes delayed spawning, reduced egg production, and altered sex steroid levels. In zebrafish, fluoxetine reduces fecundity by up to 50% at environmentally relevant concentrations (1-100 ng/L). Intersex conditions (ovotestis) have been observed, though less commonly than with hormones.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effect-card">
            <h4>Mechanisms</h4>
            <p>SSRIs inhibit serotonin transporters (SERT) in fish brains, leading to elevated serotonin levels. Fish possess orthologous serotonin receptors to mammals, but differences in metabolism (e.g., slower clearance) result in prolonged exposure. This disrupts the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, affecting gonadotropin release and steroidogenesis.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effect-card">
            <h4>Ecological Implications</h4>
            <p>Altered feeding and mating behaviors can disrupt food webs and population dynamics. Reduced reproduction may lead to declines in fish populations, affecting biodiversity in contaminated waterways.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Hormones</h3>
        <div class="effects-grid">
          <div class="effect-card">
            <h4>Behavioral Effects</h4>
            <p>Estrogenic compounds feminize male behavior, reducing courtship displays and aggression in species like medaka (<em>Oryzias latipes</em>). Testosterone-like compounds may enhance male-typical behaviors but disrupt natural hierarchies.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effect-card">
            <h4>Reproductive Effects</h4>
            <p>Feminization of males (vitellogenin induction, intersex), skewed sex ratios (more females), and reduced fertility are common. 17α-ethinylestradiol at 1-10 ng/L causes complete feminization in roach (<em>Rutilus rutilus</em>), leading to population-level effects like reproductive failure.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effect-card">
            <h4>Mechanisms</h4>
            <p>Hormones act as endocrine disruptors by binding to estrogen receptors (ERα/β) or androgen receptors, mimicking or blocking natural hormones. This interferes with the HPG axis, altering aromatase activity and steroid hormone balance. Amphibian-like thyroid disruption can occur with thyroid hormones.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effect-card">
            <h4>Ecological Implications</h4>
            <p>Skewed sex ratios and reduced reproduction threaten population sustainability. In mixed-sex populations, this can lead to Allee effects (reduced mating success) and local extinctions, impacting fisheries and ecosystem services.</p>
          </div>

    <!-- Effects on Amphibians -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-frog"></i> Effects on Amphibians</h2>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Antidepressants</h3>
        <div class="effects-grid">
          <div class="effect-card">
            <h4>Behavioral Effects</h4>
            <p>Limited studies show altered larval behavior, such as reduced activity and feeding in tadpoles of species like <em>Xenopus laevis</em>. Metamorphosis timing may be affected, with potential delays in development.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effect-card">
            <h4>Reproductive Effects</h4>
            <p>Exposure reduces gonad development and fertility in adults. In frogs, SSRIs disrupt oocyte maturation and spawning.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effect-card">
            <h4>Mechanisms</h4>
            <p>Similar to fish, SSRIs affect serotonin pathways, but amphibians' dual aquatic-terrestrial life cycle prolongs exposure. Disruption of thyroid hormone signaling (crosstalk with serotonin) exacerbates metamorphic effects.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effect-card">
            <h4>Ecological Implications</h4>
            <p>Amphibians are already declining; pharmaceuticals may compound stressors like habitat loss, leading to reduced recruitment and biodiversity loss in wetlands.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Hormones</h3>
        <div class="effects-grid">
          <div class="effect-card">
            <h4>Behavioral Effects</h4>
            <p>Thyroid disruptors (e.g., perchlorate) delay metamorphosis, altering larval behavior and habitat use. Estrogens feminize males, reducing mating calls in frogs.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effect-card">
            <h4>Reproductive Effects</h4>
            <p>High sensitivity to estrogens causes gonadal abnormalities, hermaphroditism, and reduced egg viability. Atrazine (herbicide with estrogenic effects) at low concentrations induces hermaphroditism in leopard frogs (<em>Rana pipiens</em>).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effect-card">
            <h4>Mechanisms</h4>
            <p>Hormones bind to nuclear receptors, disrupting gene expression in the HPT (hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid) and HPG axes. Amphibians are particularly sensitive due to their reliance on thyroid hormones for metamorphosis.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effect-card">
            <h4>Ecological Implications</h4>
            <p>Altered metamorphosis timing affects phenology, potentially mismatching with food availability or predators. Reproductive failures contribute to amphibian declines, with global implications for ecosystem health as amphibians are bioindicators.</p>

    <!-- General Mechanisms -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> General Mechanisms and Interactions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Neuroendocrine Disruption</strong>: Both compound classes interfere with neurotransmitter and hormone signaling. Antidepressants primarily affect serotonergic systems, while hormones target steroid receptors. Synergistic effects may occur when co-exposed.</li>
        <li><strong>Bioaccumulation and Persistence</strong>: Lipophilic compounds bioaccumulate in tissues; SSRIs persist in sediments, while hormones degrade slowly.</li>
        <li><strong>Species Variability</strong>: Effects vary by species, life stage, and exposure duration. Larval stages are most sensitive.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

        <div class="implication-card">
          <h4>Population and Community Level</h4>
          <p>Pharmaceuticals can cause cascading effects, such as altered predator-prey dynamics and reduced biodiversity. In contaminated rivers, fish populations show lower densities and diversity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="implication-card">
          <h4>Broader Ecosystem Services</h4>
          <p>Impacts on fish and amphibians affect water purification, nutrient cycling, and food chains. Human health risks arise from bioaccumulation in edible species.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="implication-card">
          <h4>Mitigation</h4>
          <p>Wastewater treatment upgrades (e.g., advanced oxidation) can reduce emissions. Monitoring programs are essential for early detection.</p>
