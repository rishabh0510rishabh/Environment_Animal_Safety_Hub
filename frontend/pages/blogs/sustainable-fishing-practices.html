    <div class="introduction">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-fish"></i> The Ocean's Future in Our Hands</h2>
      <p>Our oceans are facing unprecedented challenges from overfishing, threatening the delicate balance of marine ecosystems. Sustainable fishing practices offer hope, providing methods that maintain fish populations while supporting coastal communities and economies. Understanding both the threats and solutions is crucial for preserving marine biodiversity.</p>

    <!-- Overfishing Threats -->
    <div class="story-section">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> The Dangers of Overfishing</h2>
      <p>Overfishing occurs when fish are caught faster than they can reproduce, leading to depleted populations and ecosystem collapse. This practice threatens not only marine life but also human livelihoods and food security.</p>

      <div class="story-content">
        <h3>🐟 Population Collapse</h3>
        <p>Many commercial fish species have seen their populations drop by 90% or more. When predator species are overfished, their prey populations explode, disrupting the entire food chain and leading to algal blooms and dead zones.</p>

        <h3>🌊 Ecosystem Disruption</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bycatch:</strong> Unintended capture of non-target species, including endangered marine mammals, sea turtles, and seabirds</li>
          <li><strong>Habitat Destruction:</strong> Bottom trawling damages coral reefs, seagrass beds, and other critical habitats</li>
          <li><strong>Cascade Effects:</strong> Removal of key species affects the entire marine food web</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>👥 Socioeconomic Impacts</h3>
        <p>Overfishing threatens the livelihoods of millions of fishers and coastal communities. As fish stocks decline, prices rise, and jobs are lost. Small-scale fishers are particularly vulnerable to these changes.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Sustainable Methods -->
    <div class="story-section">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Sustainable Fishing Methods</h2>
      <p>Sustainable fishing aims to maintain fish populations at healthy levels while minimizing environmental impact. Various methods and management strategies can achieve this balance.</p>

      <div class="story-content">
        <h3>🎣 Selective Fishing Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pole and Line Fishing:</strong> Targets specific species with minimal bycatch, commonly used for tuna</li>
          <li><strong>Longline Fishing:</strong> Uses baited hooks on long lines, more selective than nets</li>
          <li><strong>Traps and Pots:</strong> Species-specific traps that allow undersized or unwanted fish to escape</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🏝️ Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)</h3>
        <p>Designated zones where fishing is restricted or prohibited, allowing marine populations to recover and spill over into adjacent fishing grounds.</p>

        <h3>📊 Science-Based Management</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Quota Systems:</strong> Limits on catch amounts based on scientific assessments</li>
          <li><strong>Seasonal Closures:</strong> Temporary bans during breeding seasons</li>
          <li><strong>Size Limits:</strong> Minimum size requirements to allow fish to reproduce</li>
          <li><strong>Gear Restrictions:</strong> Bans on destructive fishing methods</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🐠 Aquaculture Solutions</h3>
        <p>Sustainable aquaculture can reduce pressure on wild stocks by farming fish in controlled environments that minimize environmental impact.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Benefits and Future -->
    <div class="story-section">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-seedling"></i> Benefits of Sustainable Fishing</h2>
      <p>Transitioning to sustainable practices offers numerous benefits for marine ecosystems, economies, and communities.</p>

      <div class="story-content">
        <h3>🌍 Environmental Benefits</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Healthy, diverse marine populations</li>
          <li>Restored coral reefs and coastal habitats</li>
          <li>Reduced carbon sequestration through intact ecosystems</li>
          <li>Biodiversity conservation for future generations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>💰 Economic Advantages</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Stable fish stocks ensure long-term profitability</li>
          <li>Premium prices for sustainably caught seafood</li>
          <li>Job creation in sustainable fishing and aquaculture</li>
          <li>Tourism opportunities in healthy marine areas</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🍽️ Food Security</h3>
        <p>Sustainable practices ensure a reliable supply of nutritious seafood for billions of people worldwide, particularly in developing countries where fish is a primary protein source.</p>

    <!-- Call to Action -->
    <div class="introduction">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> Making a Difference</h2>
      <p>The choice between overfishing and sustainability will determine the health of our oceans for generations to come. By supporting sustainable fishing practices, choosing certified seafood, and advocating for stronger marine protections, we can ensure that our children inherit thriving ocean ecosystems.</p>
