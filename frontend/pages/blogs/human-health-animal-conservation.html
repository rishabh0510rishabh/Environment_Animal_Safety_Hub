    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="introduction">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-link"></i> A Shared Destiny: Animals and Human Health</h2>
      <p>The health of humans and animals is intricately connected. Conservation efforts that protect wildlife don't just preserve biodiversity—they directly contribute to human health and well-being. From preventing deadly diseases to maintaining essential ecosystem services, animal conservation is a critical investment in our own future.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Disease Prevention -->
    <div class="story-section">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Disease Prevention: Breaking the Chain of Zoonotic Diseases</h2>
      <p>Many of the world's most devastating diseases originate from animals and spread to humans—a phenomenon known as zoonosis. Protecting wildlife habitats plays a crucial role in preventing these spillover events.</p>
      
      <div class="story-content">
        <h3>🦇 Biodiversity as a Buffer</h3>
        <p>Healthy ecosystems with diverse wildlife populations act as natural barriers against disease transmission. When habitats are destroyed and wildlife populations decline, the remaining animals become stressed and more likely to carry and transmit pathogens.</p>
        
        <h3>📊 Real-World Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ebola:</strong> Linked to habitat destruction in African rainforests, bringing humans into closer contact with infected wildlife</li>
          <li><strong>COVID-19:</strong> Believed to have originated from bats, with habitat loss potentially contributing to the spillover</li>
          <li><strong>Nipah Virus:</strong> Emerged from fruit bats due to deforestation in Southeast Asia</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>🩺 Conservation Strategies</h3>
        <p>Protecting wildlife corridors and maintaining natural habitats reduces human-wildlife conflict and minimizes disease transmission opportunities. Programs like those monitoring bat populations in China have helped prevent potential pandemics.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Ecosystem Services -->
    <div class="story-section">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Ecosystem Services: Nature's Health Benefits</h2>
      <p>Animals provide essential services that maintain environmental health, which in turn supports human well-being. These ecosystem services have direct and indirect impacts on our health.</p>
      
      <div class="story-content">
        <h3>🐝 Pollination and Food Security</h3>
        <p>Bees, butterflies, and other pollinators are crucial for producing fruits, vegetables, and nuts that form the foundation of a healthy human diet. Protecting these species ensures access to nutrient-rich foods that prevent malnutrition and related health issues.</p>
        
        <h3>🦗 Pest Control</h3>
        <p>Predatory insects, birds, and small mammals naturally control agricultural pests, reducing the need for chemical pesticides that can contaminate our food and water supplies.</p>
        
        <h3>💧 Water Purification</h3>
        <p>Wetland animals like beavers and certain fish species help filter and purify water sources. Protecting these species maintains clean drinking water and reduces waterborne diseases.</p>
        
        <h3>🌱 Soil Health</h3>
        <p>Earthworms, termites, and other soil-dwelling animals maintain soil structure and fertility, supporting agriculture that provides healthy food options.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Mental Health Benefits -->
    <div class="story-section">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-brain"></i> Mental Health and Well-being</h2>
      <p>Connecting with nature and wildlife has proven mental health benefits. Conservation efforts that preserve natural spaces provide opportunities for recreation, stress reduction, and improved mental health outcomes.</p>
      
      <div class="story-content">
        <p>Studies show that spending time in nature reduces stress, anxiety, and depression. Protecting animal habitats ensures these therapeutic spaces remain available for future generations.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Call to Action -->
    <div class="introduction">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-hand-holding-heart"></i> Why Conservation Matters for Human Health</h2>
      <p>The evidence is clear: protecting animals is protecting ourselves. Every species lost represents a potential breakthrough in medicine, a natural pest controller, or a vital link in our ecosystem. By supporting conservation efforts, we're investing in a healthier, more sustainable future for all living beings.</p>
