# Ecotoxicology of Sunscreen Chemicals on Coral Larvae

## Overview

Sunscreen chemicals, particularly UV-filter compounds, are emerging as significant pollutants in marine environments, with profound impacts on coral reef ecosystems. Coral larvae, the critical life stage responsible for reef regeneration and colonization, are particularly vulnerable to these contaminants. This phenomenon represents a previously unrecognized threat to coral reef persistence and recovery in the face of climate change and other anthropogenic stressors.
