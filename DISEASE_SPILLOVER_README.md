# Disease Spillover Analysis - Feature Documentation

## Issue #1300: Disease Spillover Between Wildlife and Humans

### Overview
This feature implements an educational page analyzing how habitat destruction increases zoonotic disease risks and the crucial role of conservation in preventing outbreaks. The page provides comprehensive information about disease spillover mechanisms, real-world examples, and actionable conservation strategies.

### Features Implemented

#### 1. **Educational Content Structure**
- **Hero Section**: Engaging introduction with key statistics about zoonotic diseases
- **Risk Analysis**: Detailed explanation of how habitat destruction drives spillover
- **Case Studies**: Real-world examples (COVID-19, Ebola, Nipah, Zika viruses)
- **Conservation Solutions**: Six key strategies for prevention
- **Prevention Strategies**: Practical approaches to reduce zoonotic risks
- **Call-to-Action**: Interactive buttons linking to external resources

#### 2. **Interactive Elements**
- **Statistics Grid**: Visual representation of zoonotic disease impact
- **Risk Factor Cards**: Four main ways habitat destruction increases spillover risk
- **Example Cards**: Detailed case studies with origins and habitat loss connections
- **Solution Grid**: Six conservation approaches with explanations
- **Action Buttons**: Direct links to CDC, WWF, and wildlife reporting resources

#### 3. **Visual Design**
- **Color-coded Sections**: Consistent theming with project design system
- **Icon Integration**: Font Awesome icons for visual hierarchy
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-first design with flexible grid systems
- **Interactive Animations**: Hover effects and smooth transitions

#### 4. **Content Areas**

##### The Spillover Threat
- Statistics: 60% of diseases are zoonotic, 75% of emerging diseases from animals
- Economic impact: Over $1 trillion annually
- Global health significance

##### Habitat Destruction Mechanisms
- **Increased Contact**: Wildlife forced closer to humans
- **Population Density**: Stress and transmission in fragmented habitats
- **Species Mixing**: Pathogens jumping between species
- **Bushmeat Trade**: Direct transmission pathways

##### Notable Disease Examples
- **COVID-19**: Bat origin, deforestation link
- **Ebola**: Bat/primate reservoirs, mining/deforestation
- **Nipah Virus**: Fruit bats, palm oil plantations
- **Zika Virus**: Monkey origin, urban expansion
