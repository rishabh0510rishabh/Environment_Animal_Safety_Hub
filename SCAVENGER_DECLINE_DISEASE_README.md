# Decline of Scavenger Species and Disease Risk - Feature Documentation

## Issue #1543: Decline of Scavenger Species and Disease Risk

### Overview
This educational feature examines how the decline of scavenger species, particularly vultures, creates cascading ecological consequences including increased carcass persistence, pathogen proliferation, and elevated disease transmission risks to wildlife, livestock, and humans. The page provides comprehensive information about scavenger ecology, population declines, and the public health implications of disrupted carcass removal services.

### Features Implemented

#### 1. **Educational Content Structure**
- Hero section introducing scavenger decline crisis
- Overview of scavenger ecological roles and population trends
- Detailed mechanisms of disease risk amplification
- Species-specific impact sections for vultures and other scavengers

#### 2. **Scavenger Ecology**
- Natural carcass removal services and ecosystem benefits
- Vulture population declines (99% in some species)
- Competition with other scavengers (crows, foxes, feral dogs)
- Cultural and ecological significance

#### 3. **Disease Risk Mechanisms**
- Carcass persistence and pathogen incubation
- Increased disease transmission to wildlife populations
- Livestock health impacts and economic consequences
- Zoonotic disease risks to human populations
- Rabies, anthrax, and other pathogen amplification

#### 4. **Case Studies**
- Asian vulture crisis and diclofenac poisoning
- African vulture declines and rabies spread
- European scavenger losses and disease patterns
- New World vulture population trends

#### 5. **Conservation Solutions**
- NSAID-free veterinary practices
- Poisoning prevention and enforcement
- Habitat protection and restoration
- Artificial feeding stations and supplementation
- Community education and engagement

#### 6. **Interactive Elements**
- Animated population decline charts
- Disease transmission pathway visualizations
- Scavenger species comparison tool
- Geographic impact mapping

### Scientific Accuracy
The content is based on established scavenger ecology and disease ecology research including:
- Vulture conservation studies from IUCN and BirdLife International
- Disease ecology research on carcass-borne pathogens
- Veterinary pharmacology studies on NSAID impacts
- Ecosystem service valuation research
- Zoonotic disease transmission studies

### Key Statistics Presented
- 99% decline in some Asian vulture species since 1990s
- 500 million livestock deaths annually from anthrax in Africa
- $1 billion annual economic losses from vulture declines
- Increased rabies transmission by 10x in vulture-depleted areas
- 50+ vulture species worldwide, most in decline

### Responsive Design
The page is fully responsive and optimized for:
- Desktop (1200px+)
- Tablet (768px - 1199px)
- Mobile (< 768px)

### Accessibility Features
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast color scheme
- Screen reader compatible content

### Navigation Integration
The page is accessible through the main navigation under:
**Education → 🦅 Scavenger Decline & Disease**

### Call-to-Action Links
- Vulture conservation organizations
- Veterinary best practices resources
- Poisoning prevention campaigns
- Research and monitoring programs
- Community reporting tools

### Educational Impact
This feature aims to:
- Raise awareness about scavenger ecological importance
- Explain disease ecology and pathogen transmission
- Highlight human-wildlife-livestock health connections
- Promote responsible veterinary practices
- Encourage scavenger conservation support

### Future Enhancements
- Interactive disease outbreak simulations
- Real-time vulture population tracking
- Veterinary drug impact calculators
- Scavenger identification guides
- Global conservation status maps
